Elden ring notes,

Made the camera rotation bool activated with mouse right button
Dodge is little different on keyboard
>>> Dodge animation needs to change


>>> Movement gets absurd when looking the char from above

>>> when we are standing and jump an we try to move in air with W or S, we can't, (A and D is okay)

 >>> Reset on air timer on landing


Character controls are awful terrible it is just not okay not, really just not, just don't, what is this?

Create asset menu feature is awesome


Can't jump ahead while looking from above


Solved:
Researched a lot about character's feet is not touching the ground, found out the animation transforms are the cause setted offsets for Y transform, it resolved


Player was not spawning, I added start network as host/client at the world loading function, 
>>> But now the character is not in the don't destroy on load list STILL NOT THERE BUT SURVİVES FROM MAİN MENU SCENE TO WORLD SCENE
 >>>>> Solved, added start host function to the press start button
>>>>> Character falling down on start also resolved with this




 ADDED WEAPON INSTANTIATION SLOT TO RIGHT HAND TOO, // IS IT OK?





CAN'T DAMAGE CHARACTERS AFTER THEY ARE RESPAWNED
