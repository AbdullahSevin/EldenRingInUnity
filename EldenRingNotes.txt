Elden ring notes,

Made the camera rotation bool activated with mouse right button
Dodge is little different on keyboard
>>> Dodge animation needs to change


>>> Movement gets absurd when looking the char from above

>>> when we are standing and jump an we try to move in air with W or S, we can't, (A and D is okay)

 >>> Reset on air timer on landing


Character controls are awful terrible it is just not okay not, really just not, just don't, what is this?

Create asset menu feature is awesome


Can't jump ahead while looking from above


Solved:
Researched a lot about character's feet is not touching the ground, found out the animation transforms are the cause setted offsets for Y transform, it resolved


Player was not spawning, I added start network as host/client at the world loading function, 
>>> But now the character is not in the don't destroy on load list STILL NOT THERE BUT SURVİVES FROM MAİN MENU SCENE TO WORLD SCENE
 >>>>> Solved, added start host function to the press start button
>>>>> Character falling down on start also resolved with this




 ADDED WEAPON INSTANTIATION SLOT TO RIGHT HAND TOO, // IS IT OK?





CAN'T DAMAGE CHARACTERS AFTER THEY ARE RESPAWNED (REVIVED)     //      >>>  AT PROCESS EFFECT: IF CHARACTER IS DEAD RETURN HAS BEEN DETECTED SET ISDEAD VALUE TO FALSE AT REVIVE
//  PLAYER GETS HIT AND DIE, IT SAYS DEAD_01 ANIMATION HAS BEEN PLAYED, SURE, BUT WE CAN'T SEE IT, BECAUSE MEANWHILE GETTING DAMAGE ANIMATION WAS PLAYING


AFTER REVIVING WE CAN'T MOVE FREELY LOOK DIRECTION IS STUCK UNTIL WE PLAY AN OVERRIDE ACTION ANIMATION, USING ACTION ANIMATION FIXES IT BUT NOT BEING ABLE TO DAMAGE THE REVIVED CHARS PERSISTS, IT SEEMS LIKE A COLLISION ISSUE?
CAUSE MIGHT BE about assigning empty state to the animator



CHARGE ATTACK IS NOT HAPPENING AS FULL RELEASE
     >>> SOLVED, HOLD DURATION WAS LONGER THAN HOLD ANIMATION, INREASED HOLD ANIMATION'S DURATION.
	 
	
SIMULTANEOUS PRESS OF JUMP + HEAVY ATTACK RESULTS WITH A SLIDING ATTACK. FASTLY PRESSING FIRST JUMP THEN HEAVY ATTACK RESULTS IN AERIAL HEAVY ATTACK, ALTHOUGH THEY ARE BOTH COOL, THIS IS NOT HOW IT MEANT TO BE



ANIMATIONS CANCELS THE "YOU DIED" ANIMATION, RESULTING IN A MOVEMENT WHILE DEAD, AND BUGGY MOVEMENT, OFC. #8
EITHER MAKE THE DEAD ANIM TOP PRIORITY AND OVERRIDE EVERY ANIMATION
OR
MAKE A FLAG AND CHECK EVERYWHERE FOR THE FLAG, WHICH SOUNDS LESS EFFICIENT TBH
OR
DO SOMETHING ELSE (maybe disable somethings at death)


COLLIDERS (SWORD) OR (DUMMY) DOESN'T WORK GOOD, THE SWORD PASSES THROUGH THE DAMAGABLE TARGET WITHOUT GIVING DAMAGE
COLLIDERS (GROUND) OR (CHARACTER) DOESN'T WORK PERFECT, CHARACTER CAN CLIMB A LITTLE UPWARDS WHEN HE JUMPS FROM GROUND BELOW AND COMES NEAR THE PLATFORMS GROUNDS EDGES. AND SOMETIMES HE FALLS DOWN QUICKLY.

NEW BUG HAS BEEN DETECTED: LOCKON FUNCTION'S TARGET SWITCHING IS HAPPENING AUTOMATICALLY. AND INPUTS FOR TARGET SWITCHING IS GETTING IGNORED.


EP 34: ADDED spawnedInCharacters.Clear();
